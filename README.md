## Example Prompts

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant natural-language questions about your Operaton instance:

**Deployments & Definitions**
> "Deploy this BPMN file to Operaton and name it `loan-approval-v3`."
> "List all deployed versions of the `invoice-approval` process."
> "Show me the BPMN XML for the latest version of the `onboarding` process."
> "Delete the old `loan-approval` definition — it has no active instances."

**Process Instances**
> "Start a new `invoice-approval` process with business key `INV-2024-001` and set the `amount` variable to 15000."
> "List all active instances of the `loan-approval` process."
> "Suspend the instance `abc-123` while we investigate the failure."
> "What variables are currently set on process instance `abc-123`?"

**User Tasks**
> "Show me all unassigned tasks for the `approvers` group."
> "Claim task `task-456` for user `john.doe`."
> "Complete the approval task for invoice INV-2024-001 and set `approved = true`."
> "How many overdue tasks are there across all processes?"

**Operations & Incidents**
> "Are there any failed jobs with no retries left?"
> "Reset the retry count to 3 for job `job-789` and trigger immediate execution."
> "List all open incidents for the `payment-processing` process."

**History & Audit**
> "Show me all completed `invoice-approval` instances from last week."
> "What activities were executed in process instance `abc-123`, and how long did each take?"
> "Who completed the approval task for business key `INV-2024-001`, and when?"

**Decisions**
> "Deploy this DMN decision table for loan eligibility checking."
> "Evaluate the `credit-check` decision with `income = 50000` and `creditScore = 720`."

**Administration**
> "Create a new user `jane.smith` with email `jane@example.com`."
> "Add `john.doe` to the `senior-approvers` group."

## Out of Scope

The following capabilities are not available in the current release:

- **Autonomous monitoring** — AI-initiated process health watching and alerting (planned: Vision phase)
- **BPMN generation** — natural language → BPMN authoring and AI-assisted process design (planned: Growth phase)
- **Multi-engine support** — connecting to multiple Operaton instances simultaneously (planned: Growth phase)
- **Prompt templates** — guided scenario workflows for common operational tasks (planned: Growth phase)
- **UI or dashboard** — no web interface; operaton-mcp is a pure MCP server

Growth and Vision phase features are tracked in the project roadmap.

## Development

# Install dependencies (triggers code generation automatically)
npm install

# Run code generation manually
npm run generate

npm run build

# Watch mode for local development
npm run dev

# Run all tests (unit + smoke)
npm test

# Run integration tests (requires live Operaton instance)
OPERATON_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/engine-rest \
