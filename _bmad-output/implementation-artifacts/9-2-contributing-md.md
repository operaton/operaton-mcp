# Story 9.2: CONTRIBUTING.md

Status: draft

## Story

As a contributor to operaton-mcp,
I want a CONTRIBUTING.md that tells me exactly how to set up the project, write commits, and run tests,
so that I can contribute without needing to ask questions or reverse-engineer the project conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is opened **When** inspecting the top of the file **Then** it begins with the Operaton Apache 2.0 license header in Markdown comment form (HTML comment block: `<!-- ... -->`), exactly matching the operaton/operaton CONTRIBUTING.md reference format.

2. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is reviewed **When** checking the conventional commits section **Then** it contains a scope table listing all defined scopes with their coverage areas, at minimum:

   | Scope | Covers |
   |---|---|
   | `process` | process definitions, instances |
   | `task` | user tasks |
   | `job` | jobs, job definitions |
   | `incident` | incident management |
   | `history` | historic data queries |
   | `decision` | DMN / decision tables |
   | `user` | users & groups |
   | `deploy` | deployments |
   | `config` | connection config, env vars |
   | `ci` | GitHub Actions, release workflow |
   | `docs` | README, CONTRIBUTING, any docs |
   | `test` | test files only |

3. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is reviewed **When** checking the conventional commits section **Then** it includes at least 4 concrete examples covering `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, and `docs` types with real scope values, e.g.:
   - `feat(process): add bulk suspend endpoint`
   - `fix(incident): handle null incident message on resolve`
   - `chore(ci): add commitlint to PR workflow`
   - `docs(deploy): document deployment ID return format`

4. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is reviewed **When** checking for a link to the spec **Then** a link to `https://www.conventionalcommits.org/` is present in the conventional commits section.

5. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is reviewed **When** checking the contributor workflow section **Then** it covers: forking, cloning, `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, opening a PR — in that order.

6. **Given** `CONTRIBUTING.md` is reviewed **When** checking the development section **Then** it documents: running tests (`npm test`, `npm run test:integration`), the `OPERATON_SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK=true` dev mode flag, and the code generation pipeline (`npm run generate`).

## Dev Notes

### License Header Format for Markdown

The Operaton license header appears as an HTML comment block at the very top of `CONTRIBUTING.md`, before any other content:

```markdown
