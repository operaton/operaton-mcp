# Story 9.3: SECURITY.md

Status: draft

## Story

As a security researcher or user of operaton-mcp,
I want a SECURITY.md that tells me which versions are supported and how to report vulnerabilities responsibly,
so that I can disclose issues through the correct channel without resorting to public disclosure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is opened **When** inspecting the top of the file **Then** it begins with the Operaton Apache 2.0 license header in HTML comment block format (same as CONTRIBUTING.md).

2. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is reviewed **When** checking the Supported Versions section **Then** it states that the latest major version receives security updates, with a table showing supported versions.

3. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is reviewed **When** checking the Reporting a Vulnerability section **Then** it directs reporters to use GitHub Security Advisories at the operaton-mcp repository URL, and lists the required submission details:
   - Clear explanation of the vulnerability and its consequences
   - Affected versions and system environment
   - Reproduction steps with proof-of-concept if available
   - Reporter contact information
   - Attribution preferences

4. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is reviewed **When** checking the Response Process section **Then** it describes: initial acknowledgment timing, investigation and progress updates, fix release process, and advisory publication with researcher credit on request.

5. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is reviewed **When** checking the Scope section **Then** it lists what is in scope (source code, build processes, official releases) and what is out of scope (DoS attacks, third-party library issues, social engineering, local exploits without privilege escalation).

6. **Given** `SECURITY.md` is reviewed **When** checking the legal framing **Then** it references Apache License 2.0 and notes the volunteer-led nature of the project (no contractual commitments or SLA).

7. **Given** `SECURITY.md` exists at the project root **When** GitHub processes the repository **Then** GitHub automatically surfaces it in the Security tab as the security policy.

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Structure Reference

Modelled on https://github.com/operaton/operaton/blob/main/SECURITY.md — same sections, same structure, adapted for operaton-mcp:
- "Supported Versions" table: `1.x.x | ✅` (latest major)
- "Reporting" via GitHub Security Advisories at `https://github.com/operaton/operaton-mcp/security/advisories/new`
- Response: volunteer-led, acknowledgment "within a few days", no formal SLA
- Scope: source code, build process, official releases — excludes DoS, third-party libs, social engineering

### GitHub Security Advisory Link

The link in SECURITY.md should point to:
```
https://github.com/operaton/operaton-mcp/security/advisories/new
```

### License Header

Same HTML comment format as CONTRIBUTING.md (see Story 9.2 dev notes).
