# Product Requirements Document - operaton-mcp

**Author:** Karsten
**Date:** 2026-03-16

## Executive Summary

operaton-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes the complete Operaton REST API as AI-callable tools. It enables AI assistants and agents to perform the full range of Operaton engine operations — process deployment, instance management, task interaction, incident handling, job control, user/group administration, and historical data queries — without restriction. The target users are engineers and operations teams who run Operaton-powered workflow automation and want to manage, monitor, and evolve their process landscapes through AI tooling rather than partial web UIs or manual API calls.

The two primary use cases are: (1) **Operations** — querying live state, claiming and completing tasks, managing incidents, resuming suspended jobs, detecting bottlenecks; and (2) **Authoring** — describing a process in natural language, having AI generate and deploy the BPMN, then iterating on it. Together, they make Operaton fully controllable through conversational AI.

A configurable operation guard allows operators to constrain what an AI agent may do — enforcing read-only access, blocking irreversible operations, or restricting access to specific resource domains — without modifying client configuration.

### What Makes This Special

Operaton's REST API is comprehensive and well-documented, but no existing tool exposes it fully. Cockpit, Tasklist, and similar UIs offer curated, partial windows into the engine. operaton-mcp removes that ceiling entirely: every API capability is accessible, with AI handling the translation from user intent to precise API calls. The core insight is that the capability gap isn't in the engine — it's in accessibility. MCP closes that gap. This also positions operaton-mcp as a first-mover in an unclaimed space: AI-native BPM tooling via the MCP ecosystem.

## Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Developer Tool (MCP server)
- **Domain:** Enterprise BPM / Workflow Automation
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Project Context:** Greenfield

## Success Criteria

### User Success

- Any Operaton operation achievable via the REST API is achievable via an AI tool — zero capability gaps between the API and what MCP exposes
- Users accomplish complex multi-step operations (e.g., locate a failing process, inspect its incident, resolve and resume it) through natural language without consulting API docs
- AI surfaces operational insights on demand (MVP): bottlenecks, suspended jobs, anomalous process durations, task pile-ups — returned in response to user queries; autonomous proactive monitoring is a Growth feature
- The BPMN authoring loop works end-to-end: describe process in natural language → AI generates valid BPMN → deploys to engine → process is executable (Growth feature)

### Business Success

- Full adoption pathway for the Operaton open-source community: discoverable, installable, and usable by any Operaton user without special setup
- 100% of public Operaton REST API endpoints exposed as MCP tools (measurable, binary)
- Becomes the reference MCP integration for Operaton; referenced in official Operaton documentation or community resources

### Technical Success

- **Write/mutating operations:** Zero silent failures — all mutating tool calls return explicit success confirmation or a structured error message; inputs validated before execution; no partial state corruption
- **Read operations:** Data is current and accurate; minor edge cases (e.g., eventual consistency windows) are acceptable, but stale or incorrect data in normal operation is not
- Compatible with major MCP-capable AI clients (Claude Desktop, Copilot, etc.)
- No user-specific session state stored between requests; each tool call is self-contained using only the configured Operaton connection
- Over-privileged AI agent access is preventable via server-side operation guard configuration, without requiring changes to the AI client

### Measurable Outcomes

- API coverage: 100% of Operaton REST endpoints mapped to MCP tools at launch
- Write operation reliability: zero silent failures; all errors surfaced with actionable messages
- Community signal: Stars, issues, and community PRs within 90 days of release indicate real adoption

## Product Scope

### MVP — Minimum Viable Product

Full Operaton REST API surface as MCP tools, organized by domain:
- Process definitions & deployments (deploy, list, get, delete)
- Process instances (start, query, suspend, resume, delete, variables)
- Process instance migration (discover candidates, generate & validate plans, async batch execute with auto-chunking, monitor, recover, audit)
- Tasks (query, claim, unclaim, complete, delegate, set variables)
- Jobs & job definitions (query, execute, suspend, resume, set retries)
- Incidents (query, resolve)
- Users & groups (create, update, delete, query, membership)
- Historic data (process instances, activity instances, task history, variable history)
- Decisions & DMN (deploy, evaluate)
- Project infrastructure & publishing tooling (license headers, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CI workflow, release automation, README)
- Authentication: Basic Auth and OIDC client credentials; multi-engine support (multiple named Operaton endpoints, one default)
- Configurable operation guard: read-only mode, irreversible-action restriction, per-resource-domain deny; default all-allowed
- Professional documentation: polished README, configuration guide, GitHub community health files

### Out of Scope (MVP)

The following are explicitly deferred to Growth or Vision phases and are not part of the MVP delivery:

- Autonomous/proactive process monitoring and alerting (AI-initiated, not user-initiated)
- BPMN generation and natural language → BPMN authoring
- Prompt templates and guided scenario workflows
- Process optimization recommendations
- Any UI, dashboard, or web interface

### Growth Features (Post-MVP)

- Intelligence layer: bottleneck detection, anomaly surfacing, process duration analysis
- BPMN authoring: natural language → BPMN generation → deploy workflow
- Prompt templates / guided workflows for common operational scenarios

### Vision (Future)

- Autonomous monitoring: AI watches process health, alerts proactively, suggests remediations
- Process optimization recommendations based on historic patterns
- Full round-trip: AI-designed, AI-deployed, AI-monitored process automation

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Marcus — The Process Operator (Routine Oversight)

**Persona:** Marcus is a process operations specialist at a mid-sized logistics company running Operaton to automate shipment tracking and exception handling. He's responsible for keeping dozens of active process definitions healthy across hundreds of concurrent instances.

**Opening Scene:** Marcus starts his morning with a familiar ritual — opening Cockpit, navigating to the process list, clicking into each active process, checking for incidents, then switching to Tasklist to eyeball the task queues. It takes 20 minutes and he's never confident he hasn't missed something buried three clicks deep.

**Rising Action:** With operaton-mcp, Marcus opens his AI assistant and asks: *"What needs my attention today?"* The AI queries active instances, incident counts, overdue tasks, and suspended jobs simultaneously — returning a prioritised summary. Three incidents on the shipment-delay process, one job stuck with retries exhausted, and a task queue growing unusually fast on the returns workflow.

**Climax:** Marcus says: *"Resolve the incidents on the shipment-delay process and retry the failed job."* The AI confirms the actions, executes them via the API, and reports back. What used to require navigating four screens and recalling the right API sequence takes one exchange.

**Resolution:** Marcus's oversight routine shrinks from 20 minutes to 5. More importantly, the AI's summary catches anomalies (the growing returns queue) that his manual scan would have missed. He now spends his morning on the exception that actually needs judgement, not on gathering data.

*Reveals requirements for: process/instance query tools, incident resolution, job retry, task queue summary, multi-resource queries in a single call.*

---

### Journey 2: Marcus — Production Incident (Edge Case / Firefighting)

**Opening Scene:** Mid-afternoon, Marcus gets a Slack alert: the order-fulfilment process is failing for a subset of orders. No UI tells him why — just error counts climbing.

**Rising Action:** Marcus asks the AI: *"Find stuck or failed order-fulfilment instances from the last two hours."* The AI queries historic and active instances, filters by error state, and returns the affected instances with their incident messages. All are failing at the same service task — an external payment gateway call returning 503s.

**Climax:** Marcus asks the AI to *"suspend all active order-fulfilment instances and set the failed jobs to zero retries until I confirm the gateway is back."* The AI executes the suspensions and job updates, preventing further failures from accumulating. When the gateway recovers, Marcus says: *"Resume the suspended instances and retry the jobs."* Done.

**Resolution:** The incident is contained and recovered through a conversation. Marcus never had to look up endpoint signatures, construct payloads manually, or risk typos in a curl command during a production incident.

*Reveals requirements for: filtered instance queries, bulk suspend/resume, job retry management, incident detail retrieval, error-safe mutating operations.*

---

### Journey 3: Sofia — The Business Analyst (Process Authoring) *(Growth Feature)*

**Persona:** Sofia is a business analyst at an insurance company. She designs and owns the claims-processing workflow — she understands the business logic deeply but relies on a developer to translate her flowcharts into BPMN and deploy them to Operaton. The iteration cycle takes days.

**Opening Scene:** Sofia needs to add a new fast-track approval path for low-value claims. She's drawn the flow in a diagram, but the developer queue is long and every change means another ticket, another review, another wait.

**Rising Action:** Sofia opens her AI assistant and describes the new path: *"For claims under €500, skip the manual review step and go directly to automatic approval, then notify the customer via the existing email service task."* She pastes in the current BPMN XML from the repository. The AI analyses the existing process, proposes the modification, and shows her the updated BPMN with the new gateway and routing logic.

**Climax:** Sofia reviews the proposed BPMN — she doesn't read XML fluently, but the AI also provides a plain-language summary of what it changed and why. She asks for one adjustment: *"Add a variable to flag these as auto-approved for reporting."* The AI updates the BPMN. She says: *"Deploy this to the test engine."* Deployed.

**Resolution:** Sofia tests the new path immediately in Tasklist, confirms it routes correctly, and asks the AI to deploy to production. The entire cycle — design, implement, deploy — takes 30 minutes instead of 3 days. She no longer depends on a developer for process changes she fully understands herself.

*Reveals requirements for: BPMN generation/modification tools, deployment tools, natural language process description intake, plain-language BPMN explanation, test vs. production engine targeting. These capabilities are targeted for the Growth phase, not MVP.*

---

### Journey 4: Alex — The Engineer/Integrator (First-Time Setup)

**Persona:** Alex is a backend engineer who maintains the Operaton infrastructure at a SaaS company. His team has started using Claude Desktop heavily and he wants to give them — and himself — MCP access to Operaton.

**Opening Scene:** Alex has heard about operaton-mcp. He needs to install it, connect it to their Operaton instance, and verify it works before rolling it out to the team.

**Rising Action:** Alex installs operaton-mcp via the standard package manager, provides the Operaton base URL and credentials via environment config, and registers the server with Claude Desktop. He asks the AI: *"List the currently deployed process definitions."* The AI returns the list — connection confirmed.

**Climax:** Alex runs a quick validation: he starts a test process instance, queries its state, completes the first user task, and checks the historic data — all via AI tools. Everything behaves as expected. He documents the config for his team in 10 minutes.

**Resolution:** Alex rolls out operaton-mcp to his team with a one-page setup guide. The team can now use their AI assistant for operational tasks without needing to know the Operaton API. Alex becomes the person who enabled it, not the person who has to handle every ad-hoc query.

*Reveals requirements for: simple connection configuration, clear error messages on misconfiguration, stable tool naming/discoverability, predictable behaviour for validation workflows.*

---

### Journey 5: Lena — The OSS Contributor / Maintainer

**Persona:** Lena is a developer who contributes to open-source projects in her spare time. She discovers operaton-mcp, wants to submit a bug fix, and — after it's merged — helps cut a release as a co-maintainer.

**Arc 1 — Contributing:**

**Opening Scene:** Lena forks the repository, makes her change, and opens a pull request. CI immediately fails: her new source file is missing the required license header.

**Rising Action:** She checks `CONTRIBUTING.md`, finds the exact header format and a list of conventional commit scopes. She adds the header, amends her commit message to `fix(incident): handle null incident message on resolve`, and pushes again. CI goes green — build, tests, lint, license-check, and commitlint all pass.

**Resolution:** Lena's PR is merged with zero back-and-forth on process. She knew exactly what was expected because the project told her upfront. She files a second PR the same week.

*Reveals requirements for: license headers on all source files (FR-36), CONTRIBUTING.md with conventional commit scopes and examples (FR-37), CI workflow enforcing headers and commit format (FR-39).*

---

**Arc 2 — Releasing:**

**Opening Scene:** After her PRs are merged, a maintainer asks Lena to help cut the next release. She has npm and GitHub credentials configured; she's never used JReleaser before.

**Rising Action:** Lena runs the release workflow with `release_type=preliminary` and `dry_run=true` first — the log shows exactly what would be published and what the changelog would contain, without touching the registry. Satisfied, she runs it live: the `1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` package appears on npm under the `next` dist-tag and a GitHub pre-release is created with the auto-generated changelog.

**Climax:** After community testing, she triggers `release_type=final`. JReleaser creates the `1.1.0` git tag, publishes the stable npm package with provenance attestation, generates the GitHub Release, and commits the next-minor version bump back to `main`. She checks the README to confirm the tool groups and out-of-scope section accurately reflect what shipped.

**Resolution:** The release takes 10 minutes. The changelog writes itself from the conventional commits. The community knows exactly what changed and what's still out of scope.

*Reveals requirements for: SECURITY.md (FR-38), JReleaser config with auto-changelog (FR-40), release workflow with preliminary/final/dry-run modes and npm provenance (FR-41), README tool groups and out-of-scope section (FR-42).*

---

### Journey 6: Marcus — The Process Operator (Planned Migration)

**Persona:** Marcus (returning from Journey 1 and 2) has just deployed v2 of the order-fulfilment process, which fixes a routing bug introduced in v1. 200 active process instances are still running on v1. He needs to migrate them to v2 during tonight's maintenance window without disrupting instances that are mid-task.

**Opening Scene:** Marcus knows migration is possible via the Operaton API but has never done it at this scale. His concern: some instances are currently waiting on external tasks (a payment confirmation step) and he doesn't want to break those. He also knows some instances are mid-timer and needs to understand the impact before touching anything.

**Rising Action:** Marcus asks the AI to *"find all active order-fulfilment instances on v1 that can be migrated to v2."* The AI calls the discovery tool and returns 200 eligible instances, flagging 12 that have active call activities in flight — those child instances are out of scope and need separate handling. He asks the AI to *"generate and validate a migration plan from v1 to v2."* The validation response surfaces: 8 instances with open external tasks at `Task_PaymentConfirmation` (workers mid-processing), and confirms that the activity cancellation instruction on `Task_LegacyApproval` will affect 34 instances currently waiting at that step.

**Climax:** Marcus decides to exclude the 8 external-task instances for now and proceed with the remaining 192. He asks the AI to *"execute the migration for the eligible 192 instances."* The AI submits the async batch (auto-chunked into two batches of 96), returns the batch IDs, and begins polling. After 4 minutes, all batches complete: 189 succeeded, 3 failed with exhausted retries. Marcus asks the AI to *"retry the 3 failed instances."* The AI resets their retries, Operaton picks them up, and they complete within the next polling cycle.

**Resolution:** Marcus asks for a post-migration summary — 192 migrated successfully, 8 held back for manual external-task drain, 12 flagged for subprocess handling in a follow-up. He also pulls the audit log entry to attach to his deployment sign-off ticket. The migration that would have required careful API crafting and manual batch tracking is done through a conversation, with full consequence visibility before a single instance was touched.

*Reveals requirements for: migration discovery with blocking condition flags (FR-43), migration candidate analysis (FR-44), migration plan generation (FR-45), plan validation with consequence disclosure — timers, external tasks, cancellation impact (FR-46), async batch execution with auto-chunking and migration instructions (FR-47), batch awaiting with COMPLETED/TIMEOUT distinction (FR-49), batch status polling (FR-50), per-instance failure retrieval with EXHAUSTED_RETRIES (FR-51), failed job retry (FR-52), post-migration summary report (FR-55), audit log access (FR-56).*

## Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites

- A running Operaton REST API instance accessible over HTTP/HTTPS
- An MCP-capable AI client (Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot Chat, or any MCP-standard client)
- Node.js runtime (version requirement defined at implementation time)

### Installation

Install via npm (or equivalent package manager):

```
npm install -g operaton-mcp
```

### Configuration

All connection parameters are supplied via environment variables; no credentials are hardcoded:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OPERATON_BASE_URL` | Yes | Base URL of the Operaton REST API (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/engine-rest`) |
| `OPERATON_USERNAME` | Yes | Operaton user with API access |
| `OPERATON_PASSWORD` | Yes | Corresponding password |
| `OPERATON_ENGINE` | No | Engine name if non-default (default: `default`) |
| `OPERATON_GUARD` | No | Global operation guard mode: `unrestricted` (default), `read-only` (block all mutating ops), `safe` (block irreversible ops only) |
| `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES` | No | Comma-separated list of resource domains to block entirely: `process-definitions`, `deployments`, `instances`, `tasks`, `jobs`, `incidents`, `users-groups`, `decisions`, `migrations`, `infrastructure` |
| `OPERATON_DENY_OPS` | No | Comma-separated list of operation classes to block: `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `suspend-resume`, `deploy`, `migrate-execute`, `migrate-control` |

Guard configuration is global (applies to all configured engines). Invalid values for `OPERATON_GUARD` or unrecognised entries in `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES` / `OPERATON_DENY_OPS` cause the server to refuse to start with a descriptive error. Precedence: `OPERATON_GUARD` > `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES` > `OPERATON_DENY_OPS`; the most restrictive rule always applies.

### MCP Client Registration

Register operaton-mcp as an MCP server in your client's configuration file. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "operaton": {
      "command": "operaton-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OPERATON_BASE_URL": "http://your-operaton-host/engine-rest",
        "OPERATON_USERNAME": "your-user",
        "OPERATON_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Verification

After registration, ask your AI client: *"List the currently deployed process definitions."* A successful response confirms connectivity. A connection error will include the base URL attempted and a diagnosis (unreachable host, authentication failure, etc.).

## Functional Requirements

All FRs below apply to MVP scope. Write/mutating operations (marked **W**) must satisfy NFR-01 (zero silent failures). Read operations (marked **R**) must satisfy NFR-02 (current state accuracy).

**FR-35 (W/R):** Users can evaluate a deployed decision table by decision definition key, supplying input variables; the server returns the evaluation result or a structured error if evaluation fails.

### Access Control

**Operation Guard Classification**

Each MCP tool is classified by mutation type and reversibility. Classification is based on engine state mutation — not workflow intent. The following table defines the authoritative classification used by the guard system:

| Operation Class | Examples | Irreversible? |
|---|---|---|
| Read | list, get, query, count, stats, stacktrace, audit log | No |
| Create/Update | user create/update, task create/update, variables set | No |
| Suspend/Resume | instance/job suspend, resume, batch suspend/resume | No |
| Deploy | process definition deploy, DMN deploy | Yes |
| Delete | process definition delete, deployment delete, instance delete, user delete, group delete, batch delete | Yes |
| Migrate-Execute | migration batch execute | Yes |
| Migrate-Control | migration plan generate/validate, batch await, failure retrieval, retry | No |

*Classification rule: `migrate_validatePlan` and `migration_generatePlan` are Read (no state change). `deployment_create` / deploy operations are irreversible (persistent state). `processInstance_setSuspension` is reversible (can be undone).*

**FR-58 (R/W):** The server supports a global operation guard configured via `OPERATON_GUARD`: `unrestricted` (default — all operations permitted), `read-only` (all mutating tool calls blocked), `safe` (irreversible operation classes `deploy`, `delete`, `migrate-execute` blocked; all other mutations permitted).

**FR-59 (R/W):** The server supports per-resource-domain blocking via `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES`; all tool calls (read and write) targeting a denied resource domain return a structured permission error. Domains map to the FR groupings: `process-definitions`, `deployments`, `instances`, `tasks`, `jobs`, `incidents`, `users-groups`, `decisions`, `migrations`, `infrastructure`.

**FR-60 (R/W):** The server supports per-operation-class blocking via `OPERATON_DENY_OPS`; any tool call whose operation class appears in the deny list returns a structured permission error regardless of resource domain.

**FR-61:** Guard configuration is additive and denylist-based: absence of guard config means all operations are permitted. When multiple guard rules apply to a call, the most restrictive rule wins. Precedence: `OPERATON_GUARD` > `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES` > `OPERATON_DENY_OPS`.

**FR-62:** On server startup, all guard configuration values are validated. Any unrecognised `OPERATON_GUARD` value or unrecognised entry in `OPERATON_DENY_RESOURCES` / `OPERATON_DENY_OPS` causes the server to exit immediately with a descriptive error identifying the invalid value and the valid options. The server never starts in an indeterminate guard state.

**FR-63:** All permission-blocked tool calls return a structured MCP error containing: (1) the blocked operation name, and (2) the guard rule that blocked it (e.g., `OPERATON_GUARD=safe` blocks irreversible ops). The remediation hint (specific env var change required to permit the operation) appears only in the server-side WARN log (FR-64), not in the MCP error body. Generic "access denied" messages are not acceptable. Permission errors must propagate to the end user via the MCP client response — they must not be silently retried or swallowed.

**FR-64:** Each permission-blocked tool call attempt is logged server-side at WARN level, including: operation name, resource domain, guard rule triggered, and timestamp. This log is the primary audit trail for AI agent over-reach detection.

### Process Instance Migration

**FR-43 (R):** Users can discover process instances eligible for migration by supplying a process definition key, optional source/target version range, state, and business key pattern; results include per-instance eligibility status and any blocking conditions (e.g., active call activities whose child instances are outside migration scope).

**FR-44 (R):** Users can retrieve migration candidates for a given source and target process definition ID pair, receiving a structured breakdown of auto-mappable activity pairs versus activities requiring explicit mapping decisions; an optional `requiredVariables` list flags instances missing expected variable names.

**FR-45 (W):** Users can generate a migration plan from a source to a target process definition, receiving auto-generated activity mappings and a list of unmapped activities that require explicit mapping decisions before the plan can be executed.

**FR-46 (R):** Users can validate a migration plan against a full or sample set of process instance IDs; the response includes: typed validation errors, a `sampledValidation: true` flag when a subset is provided, active timer warnings per activity (instances whose timer due dates may be affected by migration), open external task conflicts per activity with affected instance count (workers currently mid-processing), and per-activity cancellation impact counts when activity cancellation instructions are supplied. Validation must reflect the supplied migration instructions — not just the plan mapping in isolation.

**FR-47 (W):** Users can execute an approved migration plan as an asynchronous batch, supplying the plan, a list of process instance IDs, optional migration instructions (explicit named activity cancellations and typed variable updates), and an optional `batchSize` for chunking; the server auto-chunks the instance set if it exceeds `batchSize` and returns an array of batch IDs with per-chunk instance counts. Migration is irreversible and one-way; the server skips instances already on the target definition version.

**FR-48 (W):** Users can suspend or resume one or more in-progress migration batches by batch ID array; the server returns per-batch confirmation or a structured error for each.

**FR-49 (R):** Users can await completion of one or more migration batches, supplying a timeout in seconds and a polling interval in seconds; the server returns a final aggregate status of `COMPLETED` or `TIMEOUT` with total completed, failed, and pending counts across all supplied batch IDs. A `TIMEOUT` result is not a failure — the batch may still be running; the response includes sufficient progress data for the caller to decide whether to re-attach or abort.

**FR-50 (R):** Users can retrieve the current status of a single migration batch, returning total jobs, jobs created, jobs completed, jobs failed, and suspension state.

**FR-51 (R):** Users can retrieve per-instance failure details from one or more migration batches as a flat deduplicated list, including failure type (including `EXHAUSTED_RETRIES`), job ID, process instance ID, and stacktrace; the list is suitable for constructing retry-safe instance subsets for subsequent recovery operations.

**FR-52 (W):** Users can reset retries on all failed migration jobs within one or more batches, allowing the engine to resume processing the failed instances without resubmitting the full batch; the server returns confirmation or a structured error.

**FR-53 (R):** Users can list active migration batches, optionally filtered by suspension state; results include batch ID, total jobs, completion progress, and creation time.

**FR-54 (W):** Users can delete (cancel) one or more migration batches by batch ID array; the server returns per-batch confirmation or a structured error for each.

**FR-55 (R):** Users can retrieve an aggregated post-migration summary for one or more batch IDs, including total instances submitted, total succeeded, total failed, failure breakdown by error type, and total duration; the report aggregates across all chunks of a chunked migration submission.

**FR-56 (R):** Users can list audit entries for migration operations from the Operaton User Operation Log, optionally filtered by process definition key and date range; results include operator ID, timestamp, operation type, source and target definition identifiers, and outcome.

**FR-57 (R):** Users can list completed migration batches from the Operaton historic batch log, optionally filtered by state or date range; results include batch ID, total jobs, completion status, start time, and end time. Complements FR-53 (active batches) for full retrospective visibility after batches are no longer active.

### Project Infrastructure & Publishing

**FR-36:** All source files in `src/` and `test/` carry the Operaton Apache 2.0 license header with the Operaton copyright notice (`Copyright Operaton contributors, Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0`), adapted for TypeScript/JavaScript comment syntax (`//`); CI rejects any PR containing files missing or malformed headers.

**FR-37:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` includes the Operaton license header verbatim at the top of the document, followed by: contributor workflow, conventional commit format with all defined scopes and concrete examples for `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, and `docs` types, and a link to the conventionalcommits.org specification.

**FR-38:** `SECURITY.md` documents supported versions, vulnerability reporting via GitHub Security Advisories (including required submission details), response process, and policy scope — modelled on the operaton/operaton `SECURITY.md` reference, under Apache 2.0 framing.

**FR-39:** `ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow executes build, test, lint, license-header check, and commitlint on every push and pull request; Node.js version is read from `.nvmrc`; all checks must pass before a PR is mergeable.

**FR-40:** Users can publish an NPM package release and create a corresponding GitHub Release with auto-generated changelog by running the JReleaser-backed release workflow; the workflow reads conventional commits since the last tag to produce the changelog, and `package.json` `engines` declares the minimum supported Node.js version consistent with `.nvmrc`.

**FR-41:** Users can trigger the `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow with two inputs — `release_type` (`preliminary` | `final`) and `dry_run` (boolean) — with the following behaviors:
- **(a) Preliminary:** publishes `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT` to the NPM `next` dist-tag and creates or overwrites a GitHub pre-release; changelog is auto-generated from conventional commits since the last tag.
- **(b) Final:** creates a semver git tag, publishes the stable NPM release with provenance attestation (`--provenance`), generates a GitHub Release with changelog, then commits a next-minor version bump (`x.(y+1).0-SNAPSHOT`) back to `main`.
- **(c) Dry-run:** passes `--dry-run` to JReleaser; produces identical log output to a live run without publishing to NPM, creating GitHub releases, pushing tags, or committing version bumps.

**FR-42:** `README.md` documents all MCP tool groups with a per-group summary of available operations, includes an explicit out-of-scope section listing Growth and Vision features not available in the current release, and includes a guard configuration section with example env var combinations for common patterns: read-only deployment, safe-mode production, and per-resource restriction.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-01 — Write Operation Reliability:**
All mutating tool calls (deploy, start, suspend, resume, delete, complete, claim, unclaim, retry, resolve, create, update, migration execute, migration batch suspend/resume/delete/retry) return either explicit success confirmation or a structured error message containing the error type, cause, and recommended corrective action where applicable. Zero silent failures permitted.
*Measurement: Integration test suite covers error paths for all FRs; verified by automated test run against a live Operaton instance.*

**NFR-02 — Read Accuracy:**
Read operations return the current state of the Operaton engine at time of call. Reads during normal engine operation must not return stale or incorrect data; eventual consistency windows during high-load engine operations are acceptable edge cases, not normal behaviour.
*Measurement: Integration tests compare tool results against direct Operaton REST API responses for equivalent queries on the same instance.*

**NFR-03 — MCP Protocol Compliance:**
The server is compatible with at least Claude Desktop and GitHub Copilot Chat MCP client implementations at launch. Compatibility is verified by functional integration tests against both clients.
*Measurement: Functional test suite executed against both client implementations; all FRs exercisable from each client.*

**NFR-04 — Stateless Operation:**
No user-specific session state is stored between tool calls. Each tool call is self-contained, requiring only the configured Operaton connection parameters. The server holds no in-memory user context between calls.
*Measurement: Architecture review confirms absence of session storage; verified by restarting server mid-session with no loss of Operaton state.*

**NFR-05 — Error Message Quality:**
All error responses include: error type, the specific cause (e.g., HTTP status and Operaton error message), and where applicable a recommended corrective action (e.g., "Check that the process definition key exists"). Generic "error occurred" messages are not acceptable.
*Measurement: Error response test cases cover common failure modes (not found, already exists, conflict, connection failure, authentication failure) for each FR category.*

**NFR-06 — Configurability:**
All Operaton connection parameters (base URL, credentials, engine name) are configurable via environment variables. No endpoints, credentials, or engine names are hardcoded. A misconfigured or unreachable connection produces an error that identifies the parameter causing the failure.
*Measurement: Configuration test matrix covers valid config, wrong URL, wrong credentials, and unreachable host; each produces the correct error response.*

**NFR-08 — Operation Guard Enforcement:**
All permission-blocked tool calls must: (1) return a structured error with the blocked operation, the triggering guard rule, and the specific env var change to permit it; (2) never partially execute or silently succeed; (3) propagate the error to the end user via the MCP client response. Each blocked attempt is logged server-side at WARN level. Invalid guard configuration values cause immediate server startup failure with a descriptive error; the server never starts in an indeterminate guard state.
*Measurement: Test matrix covers all three guard modes and all resource domain deny entries; each produces the correct structured error. Startup validation tested with invalid `OPERATON_GUARD` values and unrecognised resource/op-class names. Log output verified for each blocked call type.*

**NFR-07 — Release Workflow Dry-Run Fidelity:**
Release workflow dry-run mode (`dry_run=true`) produces identical log output and validation results to a live run without mutating any external state (NPM registry, GitHub releases, git tags, repository commits). Dry-run must be executable by any maintainer without credentials for external systems.
*Measurement: Dry-run executed against every release workflow change as part of PR review; confirmed no external mutations by verifying NPM registry and GitHub release state are unchanged after run.*
