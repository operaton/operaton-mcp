# Contributing to operaton-mcp

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **operaton-mcp** — the MCP server that exposes the Operaton BPM REST API to AI agents.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/operaton-mcp.git
   cd operaton-mcp
   ```
3. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Build** the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. **Test** your changes:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
6. **Open a PR** against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

## Development

### Running Tests

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Run all unit and smoke tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit tests only |
| `npm run test:smoke` | Smoke tests (requires built binary) |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration tests against a live Operaton instance |

Integration tests require a running Operaton instance. Set `OPERATON_BASE_URL` to point at your instance. To skip the startup connectivity check during development, set:

```bash
export OPERATON_SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK=true
```

### Code Generation

The MCP tool handlers in `src/generated/` are produced by the code generator. After modifying `config/tool-manifest.json` or the generator itself, re-run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

Do **not** manually edit files in `src/generated/` — they will be overwritten on the next generation run.

### License Headers

Every `.ts` file must begin with the Operaton Apache 2.0 license header. To add missing headers:

```bash
npm run add:license
```

To verify all files have the header:

```bash
npm run check:license
```

## Commit Conventions

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Format

```

## Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, use the issue template that best fits your need:

- **Bug Report** — structured form that guides you through steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and version info
- **Feature Request** — describes the problem you're trying to solve and your proposed solution

Both templates are pre-filled with the right labels and fields to help maintainers triage efficiently.

## Submitting a PR

When you open a pull request, the PR description editor is pre-filled with our PR template. Please complete all sections:

- **Summary** — what changed and why; link to the related issue
- **Type of Change** — check the appropriate box(es)
- **Testing** — describe what was tested and how
- **Checklist** — verify all items before requesting review

Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR. Ensure `npm test` passes before opening the PR. Run `npm run check:license` to verify all new files carry the license header.
